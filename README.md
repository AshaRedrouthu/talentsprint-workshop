Dear Asokan,

Here's a brief plan of the four sessions of the workshop. Each of these
sections will include exercises based on real-world datasets. While most of the
workshop depends only on scikit-learn, there are a few other requirements too.
An exhaustive list of Python packages required for the workshop is as follows.

Requirements:
-------------
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- keras

At most a couple more cursory packages might get added to this list as I
proceed with creating the material, but those should be easily installable at
the venue itself, assuming that the participants have a Python distribution
like Enthought Canopy or Anaconda installed.
